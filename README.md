---

The idea to to implement a light-weight alternative to Python's [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). This is a fantastic library, but has some memory issues as well has having a _massive_ API. 

...however, for the most part this will serve as an area to learn more Rust
and connecting it with Python via the [Lumber-Jack](https://github.com/milesgranger/lumber-jack) Python package I'm working on. This crate was initially born there, but better design insisted it be moved to it's own crate/repository. ;)
