# black-jack

## BlackJack is under development and not meant to be used; aside from those curious & daring few. :)

---

The idea to to implement a light-weight alternative to Python's [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), in and for the Rust community. Pandas is a fantastic library, but has some memory issues as well has having a _massive_ API; and attempting to make something comparable in Rust, just _feels_ right. :)

...however, for the most part this will serve as an area to learn more Rust
and connecting it with Python via the [Lumber-Jack](https://github.com/milesgranger/lumber-jack), which is basically a wrapper to Black-Jack. This crate was initially born there, but better design insisted it be moved to its own crate/repository. ;)
